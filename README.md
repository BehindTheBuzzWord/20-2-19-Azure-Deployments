# The Event
Behind The Buzz Word is held in a kata format - simply arrive with your laptop, have a brief introduction, and then get hands on with the task.
For this event, either create a hello world application, or download the one from this repository, and begin deploying it to the cloud using either the Azure CLI or the Azure Web Portal.

Your hosts for this event are Ross Townsend (https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossbtownsend/) and Toli Apostolidis.

# What You Need
For the event, please arrive with either the VisualStudio Code or VisualStudio Community IDE installed.
Please have a hello world application ready to go.
If you choose to use the Azure CLI, it would be really helpful for you to have this installed too - this is not necessary if you are going to use the web portal.
