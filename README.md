# The Event
Behind The Buzz Word is held in a kata format - simply arrive with your laptop, have a brief introduction, and then get hands on with the task.
For this event, either create a hello world application, or download the one from this repository, and begin deploying it to the cloud using either the Azure CLI or the Azure Web Portal.

# What You Need
For the event, please arrive with either the VisualStudio Code or VisualStudio Community IDE installed. Additionally, please have dotnet cli installed.

If you choose to use the Azure CLI, it would be really helpful for you to have this installed too - this is not necessary if you are going to use the web portal.


# What we will be doing

### Publish a Web App to Azure

As a first step, we will be deploying a web app to Azure.

### Make changes & publish

Once this is done, we will be editing the web app and publishing our changes. 

### Create CI pipeline

Create an Azure Pipeline so that every commit and push to the github repository, the Web App gets deployed automatically. 


# Azure

To access Azure you can either use `Azure Portal` directly, or via any type of integration, e.g. via `Visual Studio`, `Azure CLI` or `VS Code`. 

## Azure Portal

Create an account with azure at: 
```
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/features/azure-portal/
```

You *should* end up here:

```
https://portal.azure.com/
```

## Azure Pipelines

Sign into Azure Devops:

```
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/pipelines/
```

with your own credentials, or using the shared account:

```
Username: behindthebuzzword@outlook.com
Password: posted in slack channel
```
